# DiamondBlackjack
Hello everyone! I've spent the past 2 months working on blackjack in a style as similar to GTA:O as possible and I've decided that all servers should enjoy this so I'm releasing it!
 
[![N|Solid](https://i.gyazo.com/8d6087d72268cf1aebe5c8fec2218769.png)]()

Features:
* All networked with up to 16 players playing at the same time
* Works with OneSync & OneSync Infinity
* All the juicy stuff you'd expect from blackjack
* Optional fancy teleporter to enter diamond casino
* Fancy menu showing how to play blackjack like GTA:O thanks to RageUI!

Notes:
* This is not linked to any framework and works natively, to add chips/money into your framework/gamemode complete the two functions named `tryTakeChips` and `giveChips` at the top of `sv_blackjack.lua`
* There is no splitting or double down at this time, may come in the future
* This will probably not work with Browns casino MLO posted on the forums, since it uses different coordinates. Though you could probably fix it with a few changes.
* You will need the Diamond Casino interior - There might be one on the forums somewhere, I don't know if I'm allowed to link the one I used, but just search "diamond casino fivem" in youtube. The download link is in the description in the first video.
